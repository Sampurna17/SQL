Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Values in the tuple  form an Isosceles triangle, because A=B.
Values in the tuple  form an Equilateral triangle, because A=B=C. Values in the tuple form a Scalene triangle, because A notequal B notequal C  .
Values in the tuple  cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C .


SELECT 
    CASE 
    WHEN A + B >C AND A + C > B AND B + C > A THEN 
    CASE
    WHEN A = B AND B = C AND C=A THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELSE 'Scalene'
    END
    ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
    END
