/* Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Sample Input

For example, CITY has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY.

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4
Explanation

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths  and . The longest name is PQRS, but there are  options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

Note
You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

Answer Expanation 

For the shortest city name, we can sort city names according to their length in ascending order, and for cities having the same length, sort with their names in alphabetical order. Then we output city name and its length of the first entry. So,
1.output result of first entry ==> Select Top 1
2.output city name and its length from STATION table ==> SELECT TOP 1 CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION
3.If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically(as per the question)
   sort with length in ascending order, and then name in alphabetical order ==>ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY

For the longest city name, we can sort city names with length in descending order and then sort cities names in alphabetical order for those having the same length. Finally output city name and length of first entry. So,

1.output result of first entry ==> Select Top 1
2.output city name and its length from STATION table ==> SELECT TOP 1 CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION
3.sort with length in descending order, name in alphabetical order ==>ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
/*

SELECT TOP 1 CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY),CITY; SELECT TOP 1 CITY, LEN(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LEN(CITY) DESC,CITY;
